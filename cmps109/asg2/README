This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Mithilesh Athreya (mathreya@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working
together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort for an
assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by
a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner. The
object is to work together, learning from each other, not
to divide the work into two pieces with each partner
working on a different piece.

Mithilesh Athreya spent      7 hours working alone.
David Sun spent              9 hours working alone.
Together, we spent          14 hours working together.
Mithilesh Athreya spent      6 hours driving.
David Sun spent              8 hours driving.
