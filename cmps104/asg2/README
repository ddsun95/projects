This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Curtis Liew (cliew@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working
together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort for an
assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by
a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner. The
object is to work together, learning from each other, not
to divide the work into two pieces with each partner
working on a different piece.

Curtis Liew spent      5 hours working alone.
David Sun spent              7 hours working alone.
Together, we spent          12 hours working together.
Curtis Liew spent      6 hours driving.
David Sun spent              6 hours driving.
